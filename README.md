## Common Questions

### Why can't I sync the images to the desktop version of Anki?

Due to some implementation details of Ankidroid, when adding cards via its api, it doesn't check for
media file links in them, which makes the images files not included in the media database and
can't be synced.

To solve the problem, before syncing your decks, open the menu at the left right corner of
Ankidroid and select "Check Media". This will make the image files added by Anki Doodle syncable.
